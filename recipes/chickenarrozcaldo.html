    <p>Arroz caldo is a comforting and flavorsome Filipino rice and chicken soup served mainly as a snack but can be enjoyed any time of the day. This arroz caldo recipe will warm you up from the inside out. </p>

    <p>Arroz caldo is a lugaw (glutinous rice dish) made with chicken and rice. It’s flavored with garlic, onions, ginger, fish sauce, and other seasonings. Though “arroz caldo” is a Spanish name, the dish’s origins are Filipino — it is an adaptation of a congee that was created by Chinese-Filipino immigrants.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>1 cup glutinous sweet rice</li>
